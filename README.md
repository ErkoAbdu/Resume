## About
My name is Erko Abdurahman and am working towards becoming a full fledged web developer. I did my undergrad degree in political science and history at the University of Toronto, but I lost interest in it over some time. I later found myself working for the TTC as a subway operator for 1.5 years before committing my time to learning web development at Humber College!
